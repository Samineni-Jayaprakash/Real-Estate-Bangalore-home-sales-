price prediction based on area , sqft,bath,bhk using python
Based on the provided code, it appears that i have performed the following tasks in the project:

**Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**

Imported necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
Loaded the dataset ("bangalore Home Prices.csv") into a Pandas DataFrame.
Checked the first few rows, data types, and shape of the DataFrame.
Explored the distribution of data based on the "area_type" column.
**Data Cleaning:**

Dropped irrelevant columns ("area_type", "availability", "balcony", "society").
Processed the "size" column to extract the number of BHK.
Handled missing values in the DataFrame.
Converted the "total_sqft" column to numeric values.
Created a new feature "price_per_sqft."
**Location Analysis:**

Explored unique values in the "location" column.
Handled less frequent locations by labeling them as "other."
Filtered out anomalies in the "total_sqft" and "BHK" columns (e.g., properties with less than 300 sqft per bedroom).
Outlier Removal:

Defined a function (remove_pps_outliers) to remove outliers in price per square foot based on location.
Applied the function to the DataFrame, resulting in df6.
**Visualization:**

Created a scatter plot to visualize the price per square foot for 2 BHK and 3 BHK properties in a specific location ("Sarjapur Road").
Plotted a histogram to visualize the distribution of price per square foot.
**Model Training and Evaluation:**

Attempted to build a linear regression model to predict property prices.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Evaluated the model using the R-squared score.
Employed cross-validation to assess the model's performance.
**Conclusion:**

The analysis and preprocessing steps aimed at preparing the dataset for modeling.
Outliers were identified and removed based on the location-specific price per square foot.
A linear regression model was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy of approximately 64%.
During the interview, you could explain that the project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier removal, and building a linear regression model to predict property prices. Emphasize the importance of location-specific analysis in the real estate domain and discuss any insights gained from the visualization and modeling steps. Additionally, you may want to mention potential areas for improvement or further exploration in the analysis.
